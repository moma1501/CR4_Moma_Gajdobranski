# CR4_Moma_Gajdobranski

Hey  everybody, 

Just a couple of info!
First one for everyone who doesn't know, I am working on Satrdays so my Deadline is moved to Sunday at 18h.
Second is that I had a lot of trobles with Xampp, my SQL data base just stopped at one point and didn't want to run anymore, at the end I fixed that, but i'we lost a lot of time, so my Project looks like shit, there is no styling at all...

Sincerelly
Moma
